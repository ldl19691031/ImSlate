# Im Slate

**This is not a part of Dear ImGUI library**

![alt text](image.png)

Do you have the following problems:

- You want to use Dear ImGui in the Unreal Engine, and then you met the input focus problem like you cannot control the camera when you are interacting with the ImGui widgets

- Your programmer want to write an editor plugin with a window and some widgets, but he or she doesn't want to learn the grammar of Slate library

So this is a plugin for you: create Slate-based window in runtime or in editor, with your familiar ImGui-style APIs.
